This repository contains all the Jupyter notebooks created during the Machine Learning Lab course in my 5th semester. The lab assignments and exercises cover a wide range of foundational ML topics using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each notebook corresponds to a specific lab session or topic covered during the course. Topics include:

1. **Lab 1**: `lab_1.ipynb` ‚Äì Building a McCulloch-Pitts model to represent various logic gates  
2. **Lab 2**: `lab_2.ipynb` ‚Äì Binary classification using a logistic regression model  
3. `version.py` ‚Äì Script to check the Python version on the user's system
